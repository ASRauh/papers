### Data and scripts for Pesce et al.

### List of content
- **Rh_scripts**: Python scripts to compute the Rh using the Kirkwood-Riseman equation and the approach from Nygaard et al.
- **Rh_M1+SAXS_weights**: Rh calculated with the Nygaard et al. approach, the Kirkwood-Riseman equation and HullRad from selected conformers sampled with CALVADOS, with the weights resulting from refining the ensembles against SAXS data with iBME.
- **Rh_FM+SAXS_weights**: Rh calculated with the Nygaard et al. approach, the Kirkwood-Riseman equation and HullRad from conformers generated with Flexible-meccano, with the weights resulting from refining the ensembles against SAXS data with iBME. 
- **Analysis.ipynb**: Notebook showing the data analyses discussed in the manuscript.
- **SAXS**: Solvent subtracted SAXS data of the ten proteins used in the manuscript.
- **PFGNMRdiff.xlsx**: Diffusion profiles from PFG NMR experiments for Dss1, aSyn, GHR-ICD, NHE6cmdd, ANAC046 (with 1,4-dioxane).
- **Sequences**: Sequences of the ten IDPs used in this study.
- **iBME_tscan.py**: Python wrap to perform iBME reweighting against SAXS data scanning theta values. 

Conformational ensembles produced with Flexible-meccano and CALVADOS are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6628170
