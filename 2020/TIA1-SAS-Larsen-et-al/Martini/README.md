This directory contains a beta version of the Martini 3 force field (*beta v.3.0.4.17*) that was used in this work (v.3.0.4.17.zip).

This beta version of Martini was provided to us by Paulo C. T. Souza and Siewert J. Marrink. The final version of Martini 3, which differs from the one used in this work, is described in
