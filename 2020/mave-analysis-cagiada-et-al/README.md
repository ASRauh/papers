## Supplementary Information scripts for Cagiada et al(2020) ##

This repository contains all the necessary notebooks and scripts to run the analysis over the two paper target proteins.
The paper figures will be produced as output of the notebooks.  
The paper protein renders can be visualized using Chimera(https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/) and the relative scripts contained in chimera_script folder.

## NOTEBOOK INSTRUCTIONS ##

1. Download the jupyter notebooks in this repository.

2. Download the Input_dataset folder (which contain all the computational data for the notebooks) and place it in the same folder as the notebooks.
   
3. Download the MAVE from SI of the papers used as data sources in this work:
  - Suiter, et al, 2020 (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1915680117)
  - Mighell, et al, 2018 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.03.018)
  - Matreyek, et al, 2018 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-018-0122-z)
   and place them in the Input_dataset folder (NB.if errors occur check if their file names are the same in each notebook upload function)
   
4. Create a folder called Figures in the same notebook folder to get the outputs.

5. Now you can open and run the jupyter notebooks.

## CHIMERA scripts ##

chimera_scripts folder contains the chimera python scripts and the PDB structures necessary to obtain the protein renders used in the paper.
The pdb structures used can be download from every PDB database.
