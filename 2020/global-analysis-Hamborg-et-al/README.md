ProteinUnfolding2D
==================

This module implements a NanoDsfParser that reads data generated by a nanoDSF system from NanoTemper.
The parser returns a Unfold2DData object which inherits from a basic list and implements a number of
functions to slice and prepare the data for analysis using the Unfold2DModel class.

The Unfold2DModel class inherits from lmfit.model.Model and is used to construct and fit a user-defined
model. The class implements a number of functions for guessing initial values of some baseline and
thermodynamic parameters.

The module also includes a main function that implements the model described in the paper for command
line usage.

See module doc strings for further help.
