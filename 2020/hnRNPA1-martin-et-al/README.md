Supporting data for "Interplay of folded domains and the disordered low-complexity domain in mediating hnRNPA1 phase separation" including simulation data, SAXS data and weights after Bayesian/Maximum Entropy reweighting

All-atom trajectories of hnRNPA1* and hSUMO-hnRNPA1* with varying NaCl concentrations back-mapped from CG simulations and CG trajectories of hnRNPA1* and hSUMO-hnRNPA1* with varying PW-rescaling parameter lambda are available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4442480
