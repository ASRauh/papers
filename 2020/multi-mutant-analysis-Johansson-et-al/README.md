The results are included in the output directory. Note that we use the residue numbering of the
original data which is shifted 2 positions compared to conventional numbering (uniprot, fpbase.org, etc).

Plot from the paper may be generated based on the content of the output directory using R-Studio
notebook, plots.Rmd

Enjoy!
