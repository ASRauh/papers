The *.sh code in this directory performs sequence analisis (scoring, full mutagenesis) building a statistical model based on plmDCA. In particular:

create_PLMDCA_model_from_MSA.sh         computes the a statistical model built by plmDCA from a MSA given in input

run_saturation_mutagenesis.sh           computes the energy-score and runs full mutagenesis for the sequence(s) in input using
                                        a statistical model built by plmDCA from a MSA given in input


All the files contains a detailed HELP describing the inputs and the outputs and a usage example, to be call with option "-h" or none.

The run_*.sh can accept the sequence model for input in two ways : implicitly, specifying the MSA to use to create_PLMDCA_model_from_MSA (the relative program is called automatically), or explicitly, specifying the .mdl file outputted by create_PLMDCA_model_from_MSA in a previous instance.

N.B. : all the programs have to be run in the folder where your MSA and sequence to analyze are.
Also, you will need to update paths to run this locally

For the CI2 analysis, the following files are present
red95_CI2.fa - the MSA used in the analysis
model_red95_CI2.mdl - a precomputed model based on the above MSA
mut_screen_model_red95_CI2.mdl_ci2.txt - precomputed variant scores in a
saturation scan of CI2
