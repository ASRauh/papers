# Analyzing and comparing the radius of gyration and hydrodynamic radius in conformational ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins

This is a Python code to perform calclation of the radius of gyration and hydrodynamic radius from a structual ensemble. This code also include a how-to guide to perform BME reweighting and re-generate figures and data in main text. 

## Getting Started

The notebook file `notebook` contains all the details to generate data and figures from the main text in form of a jupyter notebooks.

In the folder `/data` you will find input files for the notebook


### Requirements

1. Python >=3.4
2. BME 
3. Numpy, Scipy libraries
4. Jupyter and Matplotlib
